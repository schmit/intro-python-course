Hello alice@stanford.com world!
What's up @ life?
A Spanish email address end with .es, as in: bob@spain.es but not charlie@germany,de
Let's try to find some easy email@addresses.com
And some harder ones, such as british@gmail.co.uk, can you find me?
This one surely@isn't.com an email address
Is your email address bob@gmail.com?
really this@must.be.
Some things might come really@damn close.
Did you know "very.unusual.@.unusual.com"@example.com is actually valid email
address (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address)?
Did you find them all?
